Let's start with obvious. Job requirements. If you don't have those skills you don't even pass hr screening.

[Todo](./BASICS.todo)

Personally i should watch more of that and gather more information.

List of commonly asked questions, terms that needed to be excelently known. This is the basics. If you struggle with answer with that you need to study
